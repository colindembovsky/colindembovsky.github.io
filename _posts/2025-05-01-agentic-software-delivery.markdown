# Agentic Software Delivery

**Agentic Software Delivery** is the practice of integrating _human expertise_, _autonomous AI agents_, and _contextual intelligence_ to continuously achieve business outcomes rapidly and securely.

This definition is very deliberate. It emphasizes integration because it’s not just about AI replacing human tasks: it’s humans and agents collaboratively amplifying outcomes. The phrase autonomous AI agents highlights proactive intelligence that assists, automates, and accelerates tasks across the entire software lifecycle. Contextual intelligence is explicitly included to underscore that these agents are deeply informed by organizational context, enabling smarter decisions tailored specifically to your software and business goals. Lastly, the goal remains clear: continuously achieve business outcomes (not just deliver software), rapidly and securely.

It’s important to realize Agentic Software Delivery is not simply implementing AI tools or automations. You can’t just deploy a model or an agent and call it "agentic." Instead, it is a thoughtful fusion of human strategic oversight, clearly defined processes for agent interactions, and contextual knowledge enabled by AI-driven products working together seamlessly to deliver remarkable business outcomes.
