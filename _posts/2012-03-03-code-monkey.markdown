I’ve just spent 4 days in Seattle at my first Global MVP Summit – it’s been great meeting a lot of the other ALM MVPs and putting faces to email addresses! It’s also been great getting an “inside scope” on some of the strategic directions that the TFS and VS product teams are taking.

On Tuesday, Chuck Sterling did a presentation and “snagged me” to be his live Code Monkey demonstrator (he spoke and I clicked around). Tiago Pascoal later joked about a t-shirt, and I whipped out my Photoshop and created a Code Monkey t-shirt, which I sent to Chuck. He blogged about it [in this post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/charles_sterling/archive/2012/03/01/code-monkey-presentation-style.aspx).
