Last week I [updated my blog engine from Blogger to MiniBlog](/colins-alm-corner--updated-blog-engine). The last couple of days I’ve been updating the theme and style. Every good blog needs some good bling!

Apart from the new look and feel, you can now also pin my site to Windows 8 or Windows Phone 8.1 Preview. When you pin the tile, you get an update of the latest posts on the Live Tile.

Let me know what you think of the new design!

Happy reading!
