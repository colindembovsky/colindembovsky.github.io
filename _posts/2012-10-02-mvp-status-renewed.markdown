I am pleased to announce that my [MVP status](http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/findanmvp/Pages/profile.aspx?MVPID=7ef0d661-a068-454d-a5f4-68ad1e3a71d9) was renewed! A large portion of that is due to this blog and all the hits I’ve gotten – so if you keep reading, I’ll keep posting!

Thanks also to Microsoft – I have really enjoyed being an MVP so far – having access to the other MVPs and the VS and TFS product groups has made my job much more enjoyable, and made me look good too!

I’ll be here all year, and remember to tip your MVPs…
