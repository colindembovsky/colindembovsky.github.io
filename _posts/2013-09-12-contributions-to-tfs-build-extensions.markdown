Some of the code I’ve written before has made it into the [TFS Build Extensions](https://tfsbuildextensions.codeplex.com/) latest release. They are my [“Include Merges (and associated work items) in a build"](http://www.colinsalmcorner.com/2013/02/custom-build-task-include-merged.html) and “[Fail code based on Code Coverage](http://www.colinsalmcorner.com/2013/02/failing-builds-based-on-code-coverage.html)” activities.

If you use the activities, make sure to leave comments or suggestions on the codeplex site.

Happy build customizing!
