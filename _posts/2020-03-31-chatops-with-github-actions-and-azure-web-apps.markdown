Over this weekend, I ported a task from Azure Pipelines to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/colindembovsky/azure-webapp-route-traffic). It was a fun project, and while I was busy I realized that I could now do some ChatOps. I decided to create a quick video which is below.

Code is in GitHub [here](https://github.com/colindembovsky/web-app-actions-deploy-sample/).

Happy chat-opsing!
