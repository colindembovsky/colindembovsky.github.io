It’s a little over 3 weeks until [Tech Ed Africa 2011](http://www.teched.co.za/) starts (it runs from 17 to 20 October). I’ll be presenting a two topics on the Development Track

- Demystifying Debugging with Visual Studio 2010 and [IntelliTrace](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264915.aspx)
- Understanding Your Systems with [Architectural Discovery](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd409365.aspx) in Microsoft Visual Studio 2010

I’ll also be doing a session with [Ahmed Salijee](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/southafrica/archive/2010/05/28/devdays-2010-guest-blog-post-ahmed-salijee.aspx) from MS South Africa on the Virtualization Track covering Lab Management.

The other presenters in the ALM sessions include my boss, Chris Menegay, as well as [Brian Keller](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/briankel/) from MS in the US.

If you haven’t registered yet, make sure you do! Feel free to catch me at any time if you have questions about ALM using TFS and VS 2010 (or 2011, for that matter!)
