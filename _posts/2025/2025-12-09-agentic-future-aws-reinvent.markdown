I recently had the privilege of presenting at AWS re:Invent 2025 in Las Vegas. In this session, I traced the history of developer productivity tools from punch cards through IDEs and into the era of AI pair programming and autonomous agents. If you missed it, you can watch the full recording below.

The Agentic Future of Software Delivery - AWS re:Invent 2024

## Session Overview

The session covers the evolution of tools designed to decrease the time it takes to get from idea to deployment (also sometimes called "developer productivity"):

1. **The Early Days**: From punch cards and batch processing to interactive terminals
2. **The IDE Revolution**: How integrated development environments transformed coding
3. **AI Pair Programming**: GitHub Copilot's code completions started a revolution in 2021
4. **The Agentic Future**: Where autonomous agents are taking software delivery
5. **Industry Themes**: What trends are we seeing in the industry - and how is GitHub building for those?
6. **GitHub Universe Ships**: What announcements and ships GitHub made at Universe (in Oct 2025)

## What's Next?

The agentic future isn't coming - it's here. Even if you are faster at "coding" you can dilute those gains if you spend more time planning and validating! GitHub's visions is to bring agentic capabilities to all parts of the SDLC so that you can scale your acceleration beyond the IDE.

Agentic workflows are not just about new shiny tools - they are about a new way of thinking and working. For more on these topics, see my posts about principles of [agentic software delivery]({% post_url 2025/2025-08-11-eight-principles-agentic-software-delivery %}) and [teaching async thinking]({% post_url 2025/2025-11-25-teaching-async-thinking-with-copilot %}).

## Conclusion

Thanks to everyone who attended the session at re:Invent. The energy in Las Vegas was incredible, and the questions from the audience showed just how much interest there is in this space. We're at an inflection point in software development, and I'm excited to see how teams embrace these new capabilities.

Happy building!
