# A New Chapter

I haven't posted in a while - perhaps that's because I've been so busy helping customers roll out GitHub Copilot! And also preparing to take on a new role at GitHub: Director of Field Services for GitHub Copilot.

Two years ago I documented a little of my career journey in Xebia's magazine - a post I called [Reflections of a DevOpsologist](https://xebia.com/blog/reflections-of-a-devopsologist/) — a path marked by curiosity, culture shifts, and the ongoing transformation of how software is built. Today, I start a new chapter.

We’re standing at an inflection point — not just in tech, but in how humans and machines collaborate to create solutions that impact businesses. AI isn’t just eating the world; it’s reshaping the very way we think about software development. GitHub Copilot is more than a tool — it’s a shift in the developer experience, and I’m honored to help shape a piece of that story.

In this role, I’ll be bridging the worlds of our Product teams and Customers. I'll be bringing insights from the field to influence the evolution of Copilot, and help guide organizations to embrace AI-native development. It’s about connecting dots, clearing the fog, and helping teams unlock the real potential of what’s now possible.

If you’ve ever read this blog, you’ll know I believe the best tech conversations start with people, not platforms. That still holds true. Only now, the questions are bigger — and the possibilities, even more game-changing.

I'm excited to see where this goes! 🧠⚙️💡

Happy Copiloting!
